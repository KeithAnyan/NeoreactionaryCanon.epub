  <p>The bizarre saga of Trayvon Martin has ended. The legal system demonstrated its independence from the court of public opinion, much to the chagrin of those who manipulate it. Even <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=200763389">NPR</a> has admitted the prosecution was weak.</p>

  <p>We are now exhorted to <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2013/0720/Trayvon-rallies-launch-conversation-on-race-and-violence">begin conversations</a> on progressives’ pet issues of race and guns, to <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/07/five-questions-a-vigil-for-trayvon-martin.html">ask questions</a> about our country’s handling of these issues. But there is a more important conversation that no one thinks or dares to have, a question that no one asks: <em>how did this become a story?</em></p>

  <p>The death of Trayvon Martin, we are told, is merely an example of a consistent pattern of ‘institutional racism’ in America, a pattern of the unjustified murder of Blacks by the enforcers of a prejudiced law. But if this is true, why did <em>this</em> death become the example? Why did this incident, not another, become an international story reported on continuously for over a year? Every development has demonstrated that the prosecution never had a case. So the question must be asked: why, out of as many cases as the narrative claims exists, did the media pick such a weak one as this?</p>

  <p>The answer is: because Trayvon’s parents’ lawyer told them to.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Benjamin Crump, Esq. @attorneycrump - Justice will always be in the court of public opinion." src="../Images/b24-tweet-1.png" title="Benjamin Crump, Esq. @attorneycrump - Justice will always be in the court of public opinion." /><!--iframe id="twitter-widget-0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" title="Embedded Tweet" width="500" height="162"></iframe--></p>

  <p>Meet Benjamin Crump: the lawyer, and one of the shrewdest manipulators of the media in America, as detailed in <a href="http://parkscrump.com/attorneys/benjamin-crump/">his bio</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In 2001, the firm represented Zaniyah Hinson. As discussed on the Oprah Winfrey Show, the two year old died after being left in a Daycare van for four hours in 104 degree temperatures. ESPN Sports Center broadcast another case the firm handled involving Leeronnie Ogletree, a 39 year old former ball boy for the Boston Red Sox, who was sexually molested by the teams clubhouse manager from the age of 8 to 17. … Also there is the matter of the “Bay Street Nine,” featured on ABC Nightly News.</p>

    <p>It is well documented that in January 2006 Mr. Crump relentlessly pursued justice on behalf of the parents of Martin Lee Anderson, the 14 year- old boy who died the day after he was restrained, beaten and suffocated at a Bay County juvenile boot camp. The camp’s security cameras captured the incident on videotape. The case has been the feature of television shows like NBC’s Today Show, ABC’s 20/20 and CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360 and continues to grab almost daily headlines in newspapers all over the nation as well as being chronicled in Essence, Jet, and Newsweek Magazines.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/08/us-crime-florida-neighborhoodwatch-idUSBRE82709M20120308">This Reuters article</a> covers the press conference that Crump held after Trayvon’s death and quoting his statement at length. (Yes, you read that right: <em>press conference.</em> Attended by a reporter from Reuters.) It reads as if it could have been written a month ago: every element of the narrative is in place.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“He was a good kid,” Crump said in an interview, adding that the family would issue a call for the Watch captain’s arrest at a news conference on Thursday. “On his way home, a Neighborhood Watch loose cannon shot and killed him.” …</p>

    <p>“What do the police find in his pocket? Skittles,” Crump said. “A can of Arizona ice tea in his jacket pocket and Skittles in his front pocket for his brother Chad.” …</p>

    <p>“He (Zimmerman) didn’t have to get out of his car,” said Crump, who has prepared a public records lawsuit to file on Thursday if the family doesn’t get the 911 tape. “If he never gets out of his car, there is no reason for self-defense. Trayvon only has skittles. He has the gun.”</p>

    <p>Since Trayvon, a high school junior who wanted to be a pilot, was black and Zimmerman is white, Crump said race is “the 600 pound elephant in the room.”</p>

    <p>“Why is this kid suspicious in the first place? I think a stereotype must have been placed on the kid,” Crump said.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It could have been written a month ago, but it was actually published on March 7—<em>2012.</em> This is the first reference to the case in the media, and yet the narrative is already written. Who wrote it? Benjamin Crump.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Benjamin Crump, Esq. @attorneycrump - He had a gun, and Tayvon had Skittles.. Just a bag of Skittles #TayvonMartin" src="../Images/b24-tweet-2.png" title="Benjamin Crump, Esq. @attorneycrump - He had a gun, and Tayvon had Skittles.. Just a bag of Skittles #TayvonMartin" /><!--iframe id="twitter-widget-1" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" title="Embedded Tweet" width="500" height="186"></iframe--></p>

  <p>The case of Trayvon Martin proves nothing about America other than how easy it is to manipulate public opinion. All it takes to turn a minor non-case into an international story mentioned in multiple presidential speeches is a lawyer savvy enough to tell the media what it wants to hear.</p>

  <p>What does the media want to hear? This is easily determined: what has the media emphasized? Race. Zimmerman, we are told, was white, or at least a “white Hispanic”; Trayvon was black; and the case is important because it shows America’s supposed racism.</p>

  <p>The mass media can be divided into two parts: progressive and useless. Inner Party and Outer Party. Fox News is the most prominent outlet in the latter wing, which positions itself as the reasonable, conservative opponent to the progressive media juggernaut. But the most it has said on Benjamin Crump’s role in the creation of the Trayvon saga is this one paragraph, buried in <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2013/06/17/george-zimmerman-trial-resumes-week-two/">a trial report</a> in its Latino section:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The shooting received little initial attention, but that changed after Martin’s parents hired Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney. He began complaining to the news media, accusing the police and prosecutors of letting the murderer of a black child go free, and contacting other civil rights leaders, including the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, to get their support.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>Perhaps it is only that Fox News is part of the media. A very powerful part it is: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites/category/Top/News">ninth in the world</a>, and sixth if you ignore Google News, Reddit, and the Weather Channel. It has staked out its demographic well—but not, one must hope, well enough; for if the only major national news outlet that attempts not to align itself with progressivism still has economic reason to let progressives <a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/alpha-assessment-the-frame-game/">set the frame</a>, all hope is lost. Progressives asks the questions—what should happen to Zimmerman? what does he signify about American race relations? and so on—and conservatives answer them, disagreeing on the answers but agreeing on the questions to be asked.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It’s frame first, frame now, frame forever. You lose the frame, and you are perpetually crouched in the defensive posture, playing by the girl’s rules, dancing to her beat, singing her tune, spasmodically twitching on her puppeteer strings…</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As it is in the media, so it is in American history. Progress has progressed for several hundred years now. Even the progression of progress has progressed; who would have guessed fifty years ago that gay marriage would become a national issue? Support for legal recognition of gay marriage <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/117328/marriage.aspx">doubled</a> since 1996—and for that matter, Gallup only started polling it then!</p>

  <p><em>Pas d’ennemis à gauche, pas d’amis a droite.</em> <a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2012/02/osullivans-first-law-in-action.php?ModPagespeed=noscript">O’Sullivan’s Law</a> has no exception. (Yes, that includes the <a href="http://www.voiceoftheturtle.org/dictionary/dict_h1.php#hurrah">Daily Mail</a>.) What is conservatism but the liberalism of thirty years ago? Progressivism is the ultimate alpha of American politics: it sets the frame for <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/lew-rockwell-and-the-strange-death-or-at-least-suspended-animation-of-paleolibertarianism">every</a> ‘<a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/04/national-review-fires-john-derbyshire-119887.html">respectable’</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/10/jason-richwine-resigns-heritage-foundation_n_3254927.html">institution</a>, and thus does it rule America.</p>

  <p>In the modern democracy, public opinion is not the unmoved mover it is frequently claimed to be. <a href="http://theden.tv/?p=81">Brahmins</a>, the caste of Americans which now proclaims democracy’s virtues louder than anyone, used to hate it. H.L. Mencken, who attacked it for holding “the civilized minority … at the mercy of the mob”, was by no means out of the caste’s mainstream. The conversion of Brahmins to the democratic faith was brought about by Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays, who taught them to manage public opinion—to <em>manufacture consent.</em></p>

  <p>Lippmann proposed that the problem of democracy could be solved by the creation of a specialized class of information analysts presenting information to media figures tasked with the persuasion of the masses and politicians tasked with implementing it. This solution is what we see today, albeit in a slightly modified form: there is no bright dividing line between the analysts and the media. There are, after all, such creatures as investigative journalists and pundits.</p>

  <p>In Mencius Moldbug’s terminology, the information-persuasion complex is called the <em><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/06/ol9-how-to-uninstall-cathedral.html">Cathedral</a></em> (<a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/07/olxiv-rules-for-reactionaries.html">so named</a> because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">it’s not the Bazaar</a>) and the implementers are the <em><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/06/ol8-reset-is-not-revolution.html">Polygon</a>.</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The great power center of 2008 is the Cathedral. The Cathedral has two parts: the accredited universities and the established press. The universities formulate public policy. The press guides public opinion. In other words, the universities make decisions, for which the press manufactures consent. It’s as simple as a punch in the mouth.</p>

    <p>The Cathedral operates as the brain of a broader power structure, the Polygon or Apparat – the permanent civil service. The Apparat is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service">civil service</a> proper (all nonmilitary officials whose positions are immune to partisan politics, also known as “democracy”), plus all those formally outside government whose goal is to influence or implement public policy – ie, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs">NGOs</a>. (There’s a reason NGOs have to remind themselves that they’re “non-governmental.”)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The universities make decisions, but nobody makes decisions for the universities. The Cathedral is decentralized: it produces a party line without a Party, and certainly without a Party Secretary.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Today’s Cathedral is not a personality cult. It is not a political party. It is something far more elegant and evolved. It is not even an organization in the conventional, hierarchical sense of the word – it has no Leader, no Central Committee, no nothing. It is a true peer-to-peer network, which makes it extraordinarily resilient. To even understand why it is so unanimous, why Harvard always agrees with Yale which is always on the same page as Berkeley which never picks any sort of a fight with the New York Times, except of course to argue that it is not progressive enough, takes quite a bit of thinking.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Needless to say, the Cathedral is progressive. It is progressive the way the <a href="http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/papalsta.htm">Papal States</a> were Catholic: churchmen always hold the dominant governmental offices. As Moldbug says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>If you were advising a young, amoral, ambitious and talented person to choose a political persuasion solely on the probability of personal success, you would certainly advise her to become a progressive. She should probably be as radical as possible, hopefully without acquiring any sort of a criminal record. But as the case of Bill Ayers shows, even straight-out terrorism is not necessarily a bar to the circles of power (especially if, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_ayers">Ayers</a>, you started there in the first place).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The wise reader must here object: America looks nothing like the Papal States! Well, of course not. It wouldn’t. As a model of governance, the Papal States leave much to be desired, especially for America, whose geography, alas, prohibits the importation of high-quality Swiss troops. <a href="http://theden.tv/?p=159">(But not all importation!)</a> A stable hyperpower simply would not have <em>carbonari,</em> so neither would it have a political structure that requires them. Just as consent is manufactured, <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/05/ol7-ugly-truth-about-government.html">dissent is managed</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>To the extent that democratic politics still exists in the Western world, it exists in the form of the two-party system. The parties have various names, which they have inherited from history. But there are only two parties: the Inner Party, and the Outer Party. It is never hard to tell which is which.</p>

    <p>The function of the Inner Party is to delegate all policies and decisions to the Cathedral. The function of the Outer Party is to pretend to oppose the Inner Party, while in fact posing no danger at all to it. Sometimes Outer Party functionaries are even elected, and they may even succeed in pursuing a few of their deviant policies. The entire Polygon will unite in ensuring that these policies either fail, or are perceived by the public to fail. Since the official press is part of the Polygon and has a more or less direct line into everyone’s brain, this is not difficult.</p>

    <p>The Outer Party has never even come close to damaging any part of the Polygon or Cathedral. Even McCarthy was not a real threat. He got a few people fired, most temporarily. Most of them were actually Soviet agents of one sort or another. They became martyrs and have been celebrated ever since.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>So Fox News’ failure to raise the strongest possible opposition to the progressives’ Trayvon narrative is not bizarre at all; it is exactly what is expected. The conservative media pretends to provide opposition, while letting progressives set the frame. As John Derbyshire and Jason Richwine discovered, it is much easier to be fired from the conservative establishment for being too conservative than for being too progressive. Maybe Fox decided not to give more coverage to the fact that Trayvon’s family lawyer wrote the entire narrative because they thought it sounded too ‘fringe’, or maybe they just thought it wasn’t a story. It doesn’t matter; they failed either way.</p>

  <p>And where they fail, we at Theden intend to succeed.</p>
